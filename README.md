# Battery Pack Simulator 2.0


MATLAB script devleoped to use simulated individual and series/parallel battery packs. 

## Current Features

- Current version includes 2 RC equivlent circuit model using, Eulers method, RK4 and IR only.
- Provision balancing algorithm is also developed.
- Includes modifed version for use in parameter sweeps.
   - Allows optimisation of balancing algorithm
- Plotter tools for various graphs also included. 

## Potential Future Upgrads
- SoC depenant dynamic parameters
- Temperature and current dependant parameters
- 'Dynamic' SoC-OCV curve
- Advanced GUI for easier interaction
